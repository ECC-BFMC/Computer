# BFMC - Computer Project

The project contains all the provided code that will run on the PC, and it's made of 4 parts:
- carsAndSemaphoresStreamSIM: The simulated stream. Sends random, simulated data about the semaphores and the cars on the track, just as our servers at the Bosch location.
- trafficCommunicationServer: The simulated server of the challenge. The car can get from this server the IP of the localization device and send to it information during the run (Speed, position, rotation and encountered obstacles.)
